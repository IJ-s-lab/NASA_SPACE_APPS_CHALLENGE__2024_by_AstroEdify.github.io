    <h1>About The Planets</h1>
    <h3>The solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. There are five officially recognized dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.</h3>

    <h2>The Definition of a Planet</h2>
    <h4>The word "planet" comes from the ancient Greek word "planÄ“t," meaning "wanderer."<br>
        According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a planet is "any of the large bodies that revolve around the Sun in the solar system." <br>
        In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined "planet," resulting in Pluto's "demotion" to a dwarf planet.
