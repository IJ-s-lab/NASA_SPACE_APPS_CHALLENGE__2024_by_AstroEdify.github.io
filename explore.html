    <h2>The Definition of a Planet</h2><br>
    <h4>The word goes back to the ancient Greek word planÄ“t, and it means "wanderer."<br>

        A more modern definition can be found in the Merriam-Webster dictionary which defines a planet as "any of the large bodies that revolve around the Sun in the solar system."
        
        <br>In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) - a group of astronomers that names objects in our solar system - agreed on their own definition of the word "planet." This new definition changed caused Pluto's famous "demotion" to a dwarf planet.</h4>
